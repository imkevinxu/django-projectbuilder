[Django Project Builder](https://github.com/prototypemagic/django-projectbuilder)
======================

## Introduction

Django Project Builder is the fastest, easiest way to build a new Django project!
Originally created by [Prototype Magic](https://github.com/prototypemagic),
this is a forked version with updated themes, packages, and opinionated best
practices I have picked up over the years.

### Features and Benefits

* Create a new Django project inside a `git` repo and `virtualenv`
  with sane defaults and best practices _all_ with a single command

* Auto-deploy your shiny new Django app to Heroku with a simple command!

* Three frontend options with CSS, JS, and HTML Templates.

* A bunch of extra packages and apps to go with your Django project

### Who is DPB for?

Django programmers using a Unix-based OS looking to do more coding and less config.

For those looking to enjoy convenient server deployments, note that
the __server scripts__ currently assume you're using Bash + virtualenv +
virtualenvwrapper + Ubuntu + Apache.  We're working on reducing the
number of dependencies.

for what's on the horizon, and for what you may want to help out with.


## Local Development Instructions

### Installing Dependencies

If you're on a Mac (only been tested with OSX 10.7 (Lion) and 10.8 (Mountain Lion) so far)
and are missing some dependencies like `pip`, `django`, `virtualenv`, or `virtualenvwrapper`
then `cd` into the django-projectbuilder repo and run

    source install_dependencies.sh

If you want to install dependencies without cloning this repo run

    curl -O https://raw.github.com/imkevinxu/django-projectbuilder/master/install_dependencies.sh && source install_dependencies.sh && rm -f install_dependencies.sh

### Local Development Usage

After cloning this repo to your local machine, `cd` into it and run
something like

    python djangobuilder.py --path ~/new_project

to create the `~/new_project` directory, which contains _tons_ of
Django boilerplate -- common imports, virtualenv creation, a new git
repo, and more! `virtualenv` and `virtualenvwrapper` are required. `git` is
recommended. Django is awesome.

### Frontend Themes

If you add the optional `--theme {bootstrap, foundation}` argument, your project
will be created using the selected theme defaults for the front-end.

    python djangobuilder.py --path ~/new_project --theme bootstrap

### Extra packages

If you add the optional `--bcrypt` argument, your project will be created
using bcrypt as the default password hashing

    python djangobuilder.py --path ~/new_project --bcrypt

If you add the optional `--debug` argument, your project will be created
with the super handy Django Debug Toolbar

    python djangobuilder.py --path ~/new_project --debug

If you add the optional `--jinja2` argument, your project will be created
using Jinja2 as the default templating engine with Coffin as the adapter

    python djangobuilder.py --path ~/new_project --jinja2


## Production Instructions

### Auto Initial Heroku Deploy

To automate the steps for your initial Heroku deploy, `cd` into your project folder and run

    bash /path/to/django-projectbuilder/initial_heroku_deploy.sh

See [Getting Started with Django on Heroku/Cedar](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/django)
for more on deploying to Heroku and the [initial heroku deploy script](https://github.com/imkevinxu/django-projectbuilder/blob/master/initial_heroku_deploy.sh) to see how it works

### Normal Server Usage

After cloning this repo to one of your many servers like AWS, `cd` into it and run

    bash gitbuilder.sh ~/new_project

to create the top-level project directory, bare git repo, and empty
${PROJECT_NAME}_site directory for the soon-to-exist Django project.
Follow the instructions echoed to the screen, which include using
`apachebuilder.sh` to generate your project's Apache config.


## Troubleshooting

### Postgres

On Ubuntu, install Postgres with

    sudo apt-get install postgresql-server-dev-all

To install `psycopg2`, Django's Postgres driver, run

    pip install psycopg2

If you get the following error when trying to install `psycopg2`

    ./psycopg/psycopg.h:30:20: fatal error: Python.h: No such file or directory
    compilation terminated.
    error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1

that means you haven't installed all the necessary header (*.h) files
to compile additional Python modules/Django apps.  On Ubuntu, run

    sudo apt-get install python-dev

to fix this issue, then again try running

    pip install psycopg2

from within your project's virtualenv to install `psycopg2`.
